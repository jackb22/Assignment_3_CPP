/* Documentation
 *
 * Program Purpose: This program reads the contents of a text file and displays the contents of the file with line numbers.
 *
 * Classes: TextFileReader -  class that reads the contents of a text file and stores the contents in an array of Strings
 *                          (textfileReader(constructor), contents(), display())
 *          TextFileReaderDemo -  class that creates an instance of TextFileReader and displays the contents of the file
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * Variables:
 *   lines - array -  of 100 std::string elements
 *   line - string -  stores the line of text from the file
 *   i -  int - variable that is used to iterate through the array
 *   buffer - stringstream -  stores the contents of the file
 *   fileName - string - variable that stores the name of the file
 *   file - ifstream  - variable that stores the file object.

 * Test Plan:
 *
 * Normal Case(valid file path, program runs successfully):
 *  Please enter the filename: /users/jackbennett/desktop/excerpt.txt
 *   Contents of the file:
 *   There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
 *   think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
 *   itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
 *   it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
 *   wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
 *   but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
 *   POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
 *   her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
 *   before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
 *   take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
 *   field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
 *   down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
 *   In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
 *   considering how in the world she was to get out again.
 *   The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
 *   and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
 *   moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
 *   falling down a very deep well.
 *   Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
 *   had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
 *   wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look
 *   down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
 *   see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
 *   noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves;
 *   here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She
 *   took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
 *   labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it
 *   was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
 *   somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
 *   fell past it.
