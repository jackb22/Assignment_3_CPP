 * Program Purpose: This program counts the number of whitespace-separated words in a file.
 *
 * Classes: None
 *
 * Notes: This program has the user declare the path of the file in the terminal.
 *
 * Variables:
 *     filename: string - holds the name of the input  file
 *     input_file: ifstream - holds the file to be read
 *     word_count: integer - Represents the number of whitespace-separated words in a file
 *     word: string - Represents each whitespace-separated word in a file
 *     filename: string - Declared in main, holds the name of the input file
 *     word_count: integer - Declared in main, holds the number of whitespace seperated words in the input file.
 *                  Returned by the count_words_in_file method.

/*
 * Test Plan:
 *
 * Normal Case(valid file path, program runs successfully):
 *    Enter the path to the input file: /Users/jackbennett/desktop/excerpt.txt
 *    The file /Users/jackbennett/desktop/excerpt.txt contains 359 whitespace-separated words.
 *
 *    Process finished with exit code 0
 *
 *
 * Bad Case(invalid file path):
 *  Enter the path to the input file: exerpt.txt
 *  Error: unable to open input file exerpt.txt
 *
 *  Process finished with exit code 0
